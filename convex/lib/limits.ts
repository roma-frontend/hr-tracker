/**
 * Hard caps for bounded Convex reads.
 *
 * Convex enforces a hard limit of 16384 documents per query invocation.
 * Using explicit `.take(N)` with a sane cap keeps memory predictable and
 * prevents silent slow queries as tenants grow.
 *
 * Use the smallest cap that still matches the UX contract for the call-site:
 *   - SMALL_LIST_CAP   — per-user / per-entity subsets (comments, children)
 *   - DEFAULT_LIST_CAP — most list-views (tasks, leaves, documents per org)
 *   - XLARGE_LIST_CAP  — admin-only reports; use sparingly
 *
 * See docs/PAGINATE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §3.1 for context.
